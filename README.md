 Welcome to the In Vivo Imaging Middleware Project!
=========================

The In Vivo Imaging Middleware (IVIM) is an Open Source project the provides the functionalities of interoperability between DICOM and the caGrid. IVIM development is driven by common use cases from radiology and pathology for common activities, such as central review in image-based clinical trials and data and application sharing in secure high-performance environments. IVIM is designed to provide grid-based, federated access to existing DICOM-based data repositories and analytical resources and to facilitate development of grid-enabled in vivo imaging applications. IVIM is layered over the grid infrastructure provided by caGrid, leveraging caGrid's core services, toolkits, and wizards for the development and deployment of community-provided services and APIs for building client applications. IVIM is compatible with caGrid 1.2.

It is written in Java using caGrid's core services, toolkits, and wizards technologies.
The goal of IVIM is to provide interoperability between DICOM and the Grid. It is designed to provide Gridbased
federated access to existing DICOM-based data repositories and analytical resources and to facilitate
development of Grid-enabled in vivo imaging applications in caBIG.
