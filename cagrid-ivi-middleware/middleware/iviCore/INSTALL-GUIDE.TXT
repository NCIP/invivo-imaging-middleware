Assuming you've already installed globus 4.0.2 and caGrid beta, and
have set variables GLOBUS_LOCATION and CAGRID_LOCATION, here is what
you need to do to setup the latest ivi middleware and gridIMAGE:

1) unpack tarballs or get cvs checkouts of the some versions of ivi,
   gridIMAGE, etc.

   1a)
   (cvs checkout of current ivi:
   
       cvs -d :ext:USERNAME@cbiocvs2.nci.nih.gov:/share/content/gforge/middleware co middleware

    svn checkout of current gridIMAGE:

       svn co svn://marion.bmi.ohio-state.edu/gridIMAGE
   )

   1b)
   (cvs export of ivi PRE_MAPPING tag:
   
       cvs -d :ext:USERNAME@cbiocvs2.nci.nih.gov:/share/content/gforge/middleware export -r PRE_MAPPING middleware

    svn export of gridIMAGE PRE_MAPPING tag:

       svn export svn://marion.bmi.ohio-state.edu/tags/gridIMAGE-PRE_MAPPING
   )

2) set IVI_LOCATION to the ivi project subdirectory called
   'middleware/middleware' (the one which contains build.xml)

3) set GRIDIMAGE_LOCATION to the gridIMAGE root directory (should have
   subdirectories like DICOMDataService etc.)

4) run commands:

$ cd $GRIDIMAGE_LOCATION; ant stubs; ant setupPixelMed
$ cd $IVI_LOCATION; ant
$ cd $GRIDIMAGE_LOCATION; ant
$ vi DICOMDataService/server-config.wsdd
(set lines like
    <parameter name="GridFTPServerListenPort" value="2811" />
    <parameter name="GridFTPServerListenHost" value="your.public.ip.or.hostname" /> )
$ ant deployGlobus

5) to startup pixelmed:

When you have the dicom images unpacked somewhere, e.g. a dir called
IMAGES, you can run the script

$GRIDIMAGE_LOCATION/extern/scripts/pixelmed-exposedir.py IMAGES

which will ingest the data into pixelmed on the fly into a temporary
db and should do what is necessary to setup and run the PACS server.
Ctrl-C would stop the server.

6) to startup globus:

$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-start-container -nosec

7) to startup gridftp:

$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -d ALL -aa -p 2811

(or whatever port other than 2811 you wish to use)

8) to test with the GUI do:

$ cd $GRIDIMAGE_LOCATION/gridCADWorkbench
$ vi conf/gridCADWorkbench.xml
(set the line(s) like

    <data-service>https://140.254.80.34:8080/wsrf/services/cagrid/DICOMDataService</data-service>

    to where your services are running)

$ ant portal
