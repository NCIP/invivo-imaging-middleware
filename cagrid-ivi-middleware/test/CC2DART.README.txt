==========
CC does not provide prior revision for modifications
 -WORK AROUND: subtract 1 from the minor revision of the current version (e.g. 1.56 would be 1.55)
 	-won't work for branches or original files
 	-wrong information if mulitple modifications were made prior to the update
 	-wrong information for subversion
 	-better than a broken link :)

Not sure what I'm missing for build errors, but they aren't working right.
