These are the template files to be copied to your new subproject's directory.

build.properties	- you should not need to modify these unless your directory structure warrants it.
build.xml		- you should modify this to generate the jars with the right set of classes.
ivy.xml			- this is file where you need to modify the most to define dependencies and products.
